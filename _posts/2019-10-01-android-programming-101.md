# Introduction to android programming

## About

This blog is about my journey into android development. I have no previous experience in this field and I am also completely new to kotlin and java.

## Before beginning

Before diving into building apps from this codelabs tutorial from google, I had to learn the basics of OOP, java and kotlin. I learnt OOP and java from multiple websites and assignments given to me at school. [Google's free udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011) helped me learn the basics of kotlin, the program that I built in that tutorial can be viewed [here](https://github.com/hvm2k1/kotlin-udacity). About halfway into the course, I was feeling pretty confident and decided to start working on [google's codelabs tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-android-training-welcome/index.html?index=..%2F..android-kotlin-fundamentals#2).

# First week

After installing android studio, downloading extra libraries, creating a virtual machine for the app to run in, I created the traditional hello world program.
